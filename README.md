# Program For Fibonacci Numbers

This is a My First Repository written in C Programming Language.

Aim of this Program is to Display Fibonacci Series upto the given Input Number using Recursion Method.

The Fibonacci Numbers are the Numbers in the Following Integer Sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....

In Mathematical Terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci Numbers is defined by the Recurrence Relation

    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
    
Time Complexity of the this Recursion Program is T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) which is Exponential.
