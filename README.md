# Program-For-Fibonacci-Numbers

This is a my first repository written in C Programming Language aim of this program is to display Fibonacci Series upto the given input Number using recursion 

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
    
Time Complexity of the this recursion program is T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) which is exponential
