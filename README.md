# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is an integer sequence defined by a simple linear recurrence relation. The sequence appears in many settings in mathematics and in other sciences. In particular, the shape of many naturally occurring biological organisms is governed by the Fibonacci sequence and its close relative, the golden ratio.

The Fibonacci numbers appear as numbers of spirals in leaves and seedheads as well.

The Fibonacci numbers are the terms of a sequence of integers in which each term is the sum of the two previous terms with

    F1 = F2 = 1, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

The first few terms are

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....

This is my First Repository written about Fibonacci Sequence in different programming languages (C++, Go, Java, Javascript and Python).
