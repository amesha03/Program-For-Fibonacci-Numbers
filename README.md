# Program For Fibonacci Numbers Sequence

This is My First Repository written in C Programming Language.

Aim of this Program is to Display Fibonacci Sequence upto the given input number using Recursion Method.

The Fibonacci Numbers are the Numbers in the Following positive Integer Sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....

In Mathematical Terms, The Sequence Fn of Fibonacci Numbers is defined by the Recurrence Relation

    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
    
Time Complexity of this Recursion Program is T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) which is Exponential.
